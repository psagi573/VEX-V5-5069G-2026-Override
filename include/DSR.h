/**
 * DSR.h
 * -----
 * Single-header version of TitanReset's public API
 * (https://github.com/tubaplayerdis/TitanReset), consolidated from
 * TRTypes.hpp + TRConstants.hpp + TRSensor.hpp + TRChassis.hpp +
 * TitanReset.hpp into one file, with every tr_ prefixed identifier renamed
 * to dsr_. Behavior is unchanged from the source you provided, with one
 * fix noted below.
 *
 * Fix: the original tr_chassis declared a `pros::Imu* imu` member that was
 * never assigned by any constructor, then dereferenced it in
 * update_display() (chassis->imu->get_heading()) - a guaranteed
 * null-pointer crash if that function was ever called. That unused member
 * is removed here; update_display() now reads heading from the drivebase
 * pose (chassis->getPose().z), same as every other function in this class
 * already does.
